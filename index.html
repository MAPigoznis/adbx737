      <p> I'm a student from Latvia and I've been programming on and off since 2014.
	  I am 	proficient in Python and have some experience with Java, JavaScript and C#.<br>
	  Outside of my studies I am an avid fan of all kinds of music and a rhythm gamer. I also produce my 
	  own EDM and IDM tracks - I have even had the chance to play DJ sets at two live events 
	  and many more online.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Conway's Game of Life</h3>
    <p>
	This was one of my first significant programming projects in Java and City Bootcamp has helped significantly in its creation.<br> 
	The project consists of a grid simulating the well-known Conway's Game of Life on a custom grid as well as some simple
	UI elements. This was coded using an object oriented approach and several 2D arrays storing grid position data.
	I also took the opportunity to try out some live data visualisation with the Living Cell graph.
